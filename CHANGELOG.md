## [1.1.0] — 2026-04-09

### Added
- **Execution Approvals UI** — full approve/deny/always-allow flow for dangerous-command requests
  - `approvals-store.ts` rewritten: real in-memory Map with sessionStorage persistence, dedup, `addApproval`, `respondToApproval`, `getPendingApprovals`, `clearResolvedApprovals`
  - `send-stream.ts` now forwards `approval.required`, `tool.approval`, `exec.approval` gateway SSE events to the client as an `approval` event
  - New API routes: `POST /api/approvals/:approvalId/approve` and `/deny` — dual strategy (native gateway endpoint → chat command fallback)
  - `use-streaming-message.ts` handles `case 'approval'` in the SSE event switch, dispatches to `onApprovalRequest` callback
  - `chat-screen.tsx` wires `onApprovalRequest` through both `useRealtimeChatHistory` and `useStreamingMessage`
  - "Always Allow" button added alongside Approve/Deny in the approval banner UI
  - Approve sends `scope` body param (`once` | `session` | `always`) to the approve endpoint
