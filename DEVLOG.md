## 2026-04-09 — Session 2

### What was done
- Completed Task 4: Execution Approvals UI (full end-to-end implementation)
- Deep-dived hermes gateway approval mechanism: agent blocks via threading.Event in tools/approval.py; resolved via `/approve` or `/deny` chat commands; gateway has no native HTTP approval endpoints (sessions capability is false)
- Rewrote `src/lib/approvals-store.ts` from no-op stub to real in-memory Map with sessionStorage persistence
- Updated `src/routes/api/send-stream.ts` to translate `approval.required` / `tool.approval` / `exec.approval` gateway SSE events → client `approval` event
- Created `src/routes/api/approvals.$approvalId.approve.ts` — dual strategy: native gateway endpoint first, then chat command `/approve [scope]` fallback
- Created `src/routes/api/approvals.$approvalId.deny.ts` — same pattern, sends `/deny`
- Updated `src/screens/chat/hooks/use-streaming-message.ts` — added `onApprovalRequest` option and `case 'approval'` SSE handler
- Updated `src/screens/chat/chat-screen.tsx` — extracted `handleApprovalRequest` shared callback, wired into both `useRealtimeChatHistory` and `useStreamingMessage`, added "Always Allow" button to approval banner UI, updated `resolvePendingApproval` to pass `scope` body param
- Updated `src/routeTree.gen.ts` — manually registered both new approval routes (TanStack Router codegen not running)
- TypeScript: zero errors (`npx tsc --noEmit` clean)
- Build: clean (`pnpm build` ✓ in 3.51s)

### Repo state
- Branch: `dev`
- Version: 1.1.0

### Next session start
- Task 5: Skill installation from web UI
  - Add "Install" button to skills explorer that calls POST /api/skills/install
  - Show installation state (pending / installed / error) per skill
  - Possibly browse and install from hermes hub registry
