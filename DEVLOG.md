### What was done

**Custom Agent Creation & Template Modification**

Users can now create their own agents with custom system prompts, identities, and model overrides — and have them automatically appear in the crew builder and template gallery.

**New files:**
- `src/types/agent.ts` — `AgentDefinition` interface: `id`, `name`, `emoji`, `color`, `roleLabel`, `systemPrompt`, `model`, `tags`, `isBuiltIn`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`; plus `CreateAgentInput` and `UpdateAgentInput` types
- `src/server/agent-definitions-store.ts` — file-backed CRUD store persisting to `.runtime/agent-definitions.json`; `getBuiltInAgents()` derives built-in entries from `AGENT_PERSONAS` with pre-written default system prompts; `listAgents()`, `getAgent()`, `createAgent()`, `updateAgent()`, `deleteAgent()`
- `src/routes/api/agents/index.ts` — `GET /api/agents` (list), `POST /api/agents` (create); validates name ≤ 40 chars, color against whitelist
- `src/routes/api/agents/$agentId.ts` — `GET`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`; returns 403 on attempts to mutate built-in agents
- `src/lib/agents-api.ts` — client helpers: `fetchAgents()`, `fetchAgent()`, `createAgent()`, `updateAgent()`, `deleteAgent()`
- `src/routes/agents.tsx` — page route at `/agents`
- `src/screens/agents/agent-library-screen.tsx` — Agent Library UI: search, filter (All/Built-in/Custom), agent cards showing emoji, color, role, tags, system prompt preview; Create/Edit/Delete/Duplicate actions; Delete protected for built-ins; stat header (N built-in, N custom)
- `src/screens/agents/agent-editor-dialog.tsx` — Create/Edit form: emoji picker grid (24 options), color picker swatch (16 colors), name, role label, system prompt textarea (monospace, resizable), model override, tags (comma-separated); supports both create and edit modes

**Modified files:**
- `src/routeTree.gen.ts` — registered `/agents`, `/api/agents/`, `/api/agents/$agentId` routes in all required TypeScript interfaces and route tree
- `src/screens/chat/components/chat-sidebar.tsx` — added `AiUserIcon` import, `isAgentsActive` state, "Agents" nav item in the main nav group (below Crews)
- `src/components/workspace-shell.tsx` — added `/agents` → `'Agents'` mobile page title mapping
- `src/screens/crews/components/create-crew-dialog.tsx` — fetches full agent list via `useQuery(['agents'])`; persona picker renders Built-in/Custom `<optgroup>` sections when custom agents exist; `addMember()` uses `agentOptions` for next-persona selection; color swatch uses `agent.color`/`agent.emoji` from unified list
- `src/screens/crews/components/templates-gallery.tsx` — fetches agents via `useQuery(['agents'])`; `TemplateCard` receives `agents` prop; member pills resolve emoji/name from full agent list (custom agents now display correctly)
- `src/routes/api/crews/index.ts` — calls `listAgents()` when minting crew members; resolves emoji, displayName, roleLabel, and model from custom agent if found, falls back to built-in persona; crew member records are now agent-aware

**Architecture notes:**
- Built-in agents are derived at runtime from `AGENT_PERSONAS` and never written to disk
- Custom agents use UUID IDs; built-in agent IDs follow `builtin-<name>` convention
- `GET /api/agents` returns built-ins first (stable order by persona array), then custom sorted newest-first
- The crew creation API is backwards-compatible: a crew member's `persona` field remains the lowercase name string; the API layer resolves display metadata from the full agent list at create time

### Version bump: 1.11.0 → 1.12.0

## 2026-04-12 — Session 11

### What was done

**Task #17 — MCP client protocol support (connect to external MCP servers)**

The MCP settings screen already existed (752-line UI with add/edit/delete and YAML generation), but it was a draft-only workflow — changes had to be manually copy-pasted into `config.yaml`. This task completes the integration by wiring the save pathway directly to the config file.

**Modified files:**
- `src/routes/api/mcp/servers.ts` — Added `PUT` handler:
  - Imports `fs`, `path`, `os`, `YAML` (same deps as `hermes-config.ts`)
  - Added `readConfig()`, `writeConfig()` helpers (local copies of the pattern from `hermes-config.ts`)
  - Added `serversToConfigDict()` — inverse of existing `readServers()`: converts `McpServerRecord[]` → `mcp_servers` dict for YAML
  - `PUT` accepts `{ servers: McpServerRecord[] }`, validates each entry, writes `config.mcp_servers` to `~/.hermes/config.yaml`, returns `{ ok, message, servers }`

- `src/screens/settings/mcp-settings-screen.tsx` — UI changes:
  - Added `saving` boolean state
  - Added `handleSaveToConfig()`: `PUT /api/mcp/servers` → on success: `setOriginalServers(servers)` + toast + auto-triggers `handleReload()` if reload is available
  - Updated `isDirty` banner: was "copy YAML instruction", now shows a "Save to Config" button (disabled while saving)
  - Updated header description: removed "until gateway config writes land" placeholder text
  - Updated YAML section label to "Manual fallback" with clear context

**Architecture:**
- Save writes to local `~/.hermes/config.yaml` (same file Hermes reads at startup)
- After save, auto-trigger of the existing `/api/mcp/reload` endpoint applies changes live without a full Hermes restart (where supported)
- YAML copy-paste fallback retained for environments where Hermes home is on a different machine

### Gotchas
- The `isDirty` copy-to-clipboard handler previously also called `setOriginalServers(servers)` — this was removed since the clipboard copy should not mark the local draft as "saved"
- `handleCopySnippet` and `handleSaveToConfig` both exist independently; save does NOT copy to clipboard

### Version bump: 1.10.0 → 1.11.0

## 2026-04-12 — Session 10

### What was done

**Task #16 — Cost tracking per crew**

Token usage and estimated API cost tracking per crew. A new **Usage** tab on every crew detail screen shows cumulative input/output tokens per agent and an estimated cost based on a built-in model price table.

**New files:**
- `src/types/cost.ts` — `MemberUsage`, `CrewUsage`, `CostStoreData` types
- `src/server/cost-store.ts` — file-backed store in `.runtime/costs.json`; price table for Anthropic/OpenAI/Google models with fuzzy matching; `recordMemberUsage()` upserts cumulative totals and re-derives crew-level sums; `deleteCrewUsage()` called on crew deletion
- `src/routes/api/crews/$crewId.usage.ts` — `GET` (fetch usage), `POST` (record member snapshot), `DELETE` (reset crew usage)
- `src/lib/cost-api.ts` — client helpers including `fetchAndRecordUsage()` which chains: fetch `/api/context-usage` for token data → POST to usage endpoint → invalidate `['crew-usage', crewId]` query
- `src/screens/crews/components/cost-panel.tsx` — Usage tab UI: KPI strip (total tokens, input/output split, est. cost), per-agent table with model badges, portable-mode notice, reset button

**Modified files:**
- `src/routes/api/context-usage.ts` — purely additive: added `inputTokens` and `outputTokens` to all three return paths; these were already computed (lines 118-119) but not returned
- `src/routes/api/crews/$crewId.ts` — added `deleteCrewUsage(params.crewId)` in DELETE handler (alongside existing `deleteWorkflow`)
- `src/screens/crews/crew-detail-screen.tsx` — added `'usage'` to tab union type; `BarChartIcon` import; `CostPanel` import; `fetchAndRecordUsage` called in `handleRunEnd` after status update; Usage tab in tab bar + body

**Architecture decisions:**
- Pull-on-done pattern: client queries Hermes session API after each `done` SSE event (no changes to `send-stream.ts`)
- Token data requires Hermes enhanced mode; portable mode gracefully shows dashes
- Cost store is separate from crew store to avoid bloating `crews.json`

### Price table models covered
Anthropic: claude-opus-4-6/4-5, claude-sonnet-4-6/4-5/4, claude-haiku-4-5/3.5, claude-3-opus
OpenAI: gpt-4.1, gpt-4.1-mini, gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4-turbo, o1, o3-mini
Google: gemini-2.5-pro, gemini-2.5-flash, gemini-2.0-flash

### Gotchas encountered
- `context-usage.ts` already computed `inputTokens`/`outputTokens` at lines 118-119 but never returned them — the fix was a two-line addition to the return JSON
- Zero-token entries (portable mode) are recorded if context-usage returns any data but filtered out of `fetchAndRecordUsage` with a guard (`if (inputTokens === 0 && outputTokens === 0) return`)

### Version bump: 1.9.0 → 1.10.0

## 2026-04-12 — Session 9

### What was done

**Task #15 — Agent/crew templates**

Pre-built crew configurations that let you jump-start any crew with a known-good composition. A Templates button opens a filterable gallery; selecting a template pre-fills the New Crew dialog and closes the gallery.

**New files:**
- `src/types/template.ts` — `CrewTemplate`, `CrewTemplateMember`, `CrewTemplateCategory` types
- `src/server/template-store.ts` — 7 hardcoded built-in templates + file-backed user templates in `.runtime/templates.json`; same in-memory/sync-write pattern as `crew-store.ts`
- `src/routes/api/crews/templates/index.ts` — `GET /api/crews/templates` (list), `POST /api/crews/templates` (create user template) with full validation
- `src/routes/api/crews/templates/$id.ts` — `DELETE /api/crews/templates/:id` with built-in protection (403 on attempts to delete built-ins)
- `src/lib/templates-api.ts` — `fetchTemplates()`, `createUserTemplate()`, `deleteUserTemplate()` client helpers
- `src/screens/crews/components/templates-gallery.tsx` — modal gallery with category filter tabs (All / Research / Engineering / Creative / Operations), template cards with persona chip row, "Use Template" and (for user templates) trash-icon delete buttons; TanStack Query `['crew-templates']` key

**Modified files:**
- `src/screens/crews/components/create-crew-dialog.tsx` — added `initialName?`, `initialGoal?`, `initialMembers?` props; `useEffect` reset now uses initial values so the dialog reflects the template on open
- `src/screens/crews/crews-screen.tsx` — added `galleryOpen`, `prefilledName/Goal/Members` state; `handleSelectTemplate()` chains gallery close → prefill → dialog open; **Templates** button added to header (uses `GridViewIcon`); `clearPrefill()` called on dialog close and after successful create

**Built-in templates (7):**

| id | name | category | members |
|---|---|---|---|
| `builtin-research-team` | Research Team | research | Luna (executor), Ada (reviewer), Kai (coordinator) |
| `builtin-deep-dive` | Deep Dive | research | Luna (executor), Roger (executor), Kai (coordinator) |
| `builtin-fullstack-squad` | Full-Stack Squad | engineering | Kai (coordinator), Roger, Sally, Max, Ada |
| `builtin-code-review` | Code Review Crew | engineering | Ada (executor), Luna (reviewer), Nova (specialist) |
| `builtin-content-studio` | Content Studio | creative | Bill (coordinator), Luna (executor), Roger (reviewer) |
| `builtin-ops-team` | Ops Team | operations | Max (coordinator), Sally, Kai (executors) |
| `builtin-sprint-team` | Sprint Team | operations | Kai (coordinator), Roger, Sally (executors), Ada (reviewer) |

### Gotchas encountered

- **`GridViewIcon`** — confirmed to exist in `@hugeicons/core-free-icons` CJS bundle before using; many similarly-named icons don't exist
- **`useEffect` dependency array in `CreateCrewDialog`** — `initialMembers` added to deps so resetting works correctly when the same dialog re-opens with a new template; the parent stores prefill in state (not computed inline) to avoid re-render loops
- **`clearPrefill()` called in two places** — `onOpenChange(false)` handler and `createMutation.onSuccess`; both paths are needed because users can close the dialog without submitting

### Version bump: 1.8.0 → 1.9.0

## 2026-04-12 — Session 8

### What was done

Three improvements across two tasks:

**Task #12 fix — Knowledge Graph: dialog → split-pane**
- The force-directed graph was buried inside a dialog triggered by a small "Graph view" button; most users never found it
- Replaced the dialog with a **Pages / Graph toggle** in the Knowledge browser header — both views share the left file-tree column; the right pane switches between page content and the graph canvas
- Graph data now fetched eagerly on mount (not lazy); clicking a graph node selects the page and auto-switches back to Pages view
- Dialog imports removed; `GraphCanvas` SVG height changed from fixed `h-[540px]` to `h-full` to fill the pane

**Task #13 — Crew/agent status dashboard (aggregate metrics)**
- Added `StatsStrip` component at the top of the Crews list screen (above the crew grid)
- Six stat chips: **Crews**, **Active** (green pulse when >0), **Paused**, **Complete**, **Agents**, **Running** (green pulse when >0)
- `RecentActivityFeed` below: surfaces latest `lastActivity` snippets from members across all crews, sorted by recency, max 6 entries
- Zero new API calls — all data derived from the `crews` query already polling every 10 s

**Task #14 — Visual Workflow Builder (DAG editor)**

Full implementation of a DAG-structured task pipeline editor as a new "Workflow" tab on every crew detail screen.

**New files:**
- `src/types/workflow.ts` — shared types: `WorkflowTask`, `WorkflowEdge`, `Workflow`
- `src/server/workflow-store.ts` — file-backed persistence at `.runtime/workflows.json`, one workflow per crew; same in-memory + deferred disk write pattern as crew-store
- `src/routes/api/crews/$crewId.workflow.ts` — GET / PUT / DELETE; PUT validates edge references and runs DFS cycle detection (400 on cycle)
- `src/lib/workflow-api.ts` — client fetch helpers
- `src/screens/crews/components/workflow-builder.tsx` — the canvas component + runner hook

**Modified files:**
- `src/screens/crews/crew-detail-screen.tsx` — added "Overview" / "Workflow" tab bar; Workflow tab renders `<WorkflowBuilder />`
- `src/routes/api/crews/$crewId.ts` — crew DELETE now also calls `deleteWorkflow()` to keep storage clean

**Canvas implementation (pure SVG, no new library deps):**
- Nodes: `<rect>` (176 × 68 px, r=8) with status tint overlay, task label, assignee text, status badge, input/output port circles
- Edges: cubic bezier `<path>` with SVG `<marker>` arrowhead; active edges highlight green; wide invisible hit path for click-to-delete
- Pan: pointer capture on SVG background drag
- Zoom: non-passive wheel listener (0.2×–4×) + toolbar +/−/⊙ buttons
- Node drag: `data-tid` attribute hit-test + pointer capture, delta converted via viewBox ratio

**Interactions:**
- **Add Task** — toolbar button opens modal: label, prompt (textarea), assignee (crew member select)
- **Connect mode** — toolbar toggle; click source node (highlights), click target node → creates directed edge; cycle check runs before adding; Esc cancels
- **Auto Layout** — Kahn's BFS topological layers; nodes spread left-to-right in columns, vertically centred per layer
- **Edit Task** — double-click node or "Edit Task" button in side panel; edit label/prompt/assignee
- **Delete Task** — removes node and all its connected edges
- **Delete Edge** — click edge (wide transparent hit area) or × button in side panel dependency list
- **Save** — explicit "Save" button; only enabled when dirty; persists to `.runtime/workflows.json` via PUT
- **Clear** — delete entire workflow with confirm()

**Execution engine (client-side, no new server state):**
- `topoLayers()` — Kahn's BFS producing `string[][]` where each inner array is a parallel execution layer
- "Run Workflow" dispatches layer 0 in parallel via existing `dispatchTask()` API; tracks sessionKey→taskId in a `pendingRef` Map
- Separate `EventSource('/api/chat-events')` opened while running; `run_end` / `done` events matched by sessionKey; on task completion the layer completion check fires
- When all tasks in a layer complete, the next layer dispatches automatically
- If any task errors: execution halts, error shown in toolbar, remaining layers skipped
- Per-node visual status updates in real time: idle → running (green border) → done (indigo) / error (red)

**TypeScript:** zero new errors (build passes clean; 4 pre-existing errors in unrelated files unchanged)

### Repo state
- Branch: `main`

---

## 2026-04-12 — Session 7

### What was done
- Hermes gateway updated (399 new commits, v0.8.0 → current; 78 new bundled skills)
- Compatibility audit against the update — identified 4 gaps
- Closed all 4 gaps

**Gap 1 — Config migration (v13 → v16)**
- Ran `hermes config migrate` to apply 3 version bumps:
  - v13→14: migrated legacy flat `stt.model` to provider-specific section
  - v14→15: added `display.interim_assistant_messages: true`
  - v15→16: renamed `display.tool_progress_overrides` → `display.platforms`
- The `--quiet` flag doesn't exist; migration was invoked via Python directly to work around a skill-config probe crash that exited before the version bump

**Gap 2 — Status messages toggle**
- Added "Status messages" `Switch` row to Display settings
- Reads/writes `display.interim_assistant_messages` — controls whether the gateway shows natural mid-turn assistant status messages
- Slotted between Streaming and Show reasoning rows in `src/routes/settings/index.tsx`

**Gap 3 — Live run streaming in Jobs UI**
- `POST /api/jobs/{job_id}/run` has no `run_id` return value; `/v1/runs` is a separate parallel runner
- Used `/v1/runs` as the "Run now" execution path for live feedback; scheduled cron runs still go through job system
- New Studio server routes:
  - `src/routes/api/hermes-runs.ts` — POST proxy to `/v1/runs`
  - `src/routes/api/hermes-runs.$runId.events.ts` — SSE passthrough proxy to `/v1/runs/{runId}/events`
- `src/lib/jobs-api.ts`: added `startRun(prompt)` → run_id, `RunEvent` type
- `src/screens/jobs/jobs-screen.tsx`:
  - `formatRunEventLabel()` maps backend event names to human labels
  - `JobCard` gains `activeRunId` state, `useEffect` subscribing to `EventSource`, live log + response text accumulator, auto-expand on trigger
  - "Run now" button calls `startRun()`, falls back to fire-and-forget on failure
  - Expanded panel switches between "Live run" (pulsing indicator + event log) and "Run history"
- Both routes registered in `src/routeTree.gen.ts` (7 locations: imports, constants, 3 interfaces, RoutesById, rootRouteChildren)

**Gap 4 — Session reset + per-platform display overrides in Settings**
- `AddPlatformOverride` component added: dropdown of 13 known platforms, add/remove overrides
- Agent Behavior section: session reset mode selector (`none`/`daily`/`idle`/`both`) + conditional "Reset hour" and "Idle timeout" inputs
- Display section: per-platform `tool_progress` overrides editor (all/new only/verbose/off per platform)

**TypeScript:** zero new errors (`npx tsc --noEmit` — only 5 pre-existing errors in unrelated files)

### Repo state
- Branch: `dev`
- Version: 1.7.0

### Next session start
- Task 6 (Feature 1 — Approvals UI): remaining items — "Approve for Session" scope button, resolved-approval receipt in message timeline, global approval badge in sidebar
- Task 7 (Feature 4 — Permissions & Config UI): `command_allowlist` editor, website blocklist domain editor, `quick_commands` editor, chat platform tokens in Integrations

---

## 2026-04-10 — Session 6

### What was done
- Completed Task 8: Session Persistence via Redis

**Research findings:**
- `local-session-store.ts` already existed with correct logic but was dead code — never imported by any API route
- All session/history routes returned empty data in portable mode (gateway unavailable)
- `send-stream.ts` streamed messages but never saved them anywhere in portable mode
- `ioredis` not previously installed; file-based `.runtime/local-sessions.json` approach was designed but inactive

**What was implemented:**
- `local-session-store.ts` extended with optional Redis backend:
  - `tryInitRedis()` — non-blocking async init; pings Redis and merges Redis data into in-memory store
  - `loadFromRedis()` / `saveSessionToRedis()` / `appendMessageToRedis()` / `deleteSessionFromRedis()` helpers
  - Redis key schema: `hermes:studio:sessions` (hash), `hermes:studio:messages:{id}` (list), 30-day TTL
  - Graceful fallback: if `REDIS_URL` unset or Redis unreachable, file store used transparently
- `/api/sessions` — all 4 verbs wired to local store when gateway unavailable:
  - GET: returns `listLocalSessions()` with session metadata
  - POST: calls `ensureLocalSession(friendlyId, model)` — persisted immediately
  - PATCH: calls `updateLocalSessionTitle(sessionKey, label)` — persistent rename
  - DELETE: calls `deleteLocalSession(sessionKey)` — removes from file + Redis
- `/api/history` — when gateway unavailable: resolves session key (explicit → latest → 'new'), returns `getLocalMessages().map(toLocalChatMessage)`
- `send-stream.ts` — portable mode now saves messages:
  - Before stream: `ensureLocalSession(key)` + `appendLocalMessage({ role: 'user', ... })`
  - After stream: `appendLocalMessage({ role: 'assistant', content: accumulated })`
- `ioredis` added as runtime dependency via `pnpm add ioredis`
- `.env.example` updated with `REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379` comment block

**Tests passed (standalone Node.js test script):**
- Session create + file written ✅
- Reload from disk after memory clear (server restart simulation) ✅
- Messages preserved across reload ✅
- Delete session ✅
- 500-message cap enforcement ✅
- TypeScript: zero errors ✅
- Build: clean ✅

### Repo state
- Branch: `dev` → merged to `main`
- Version: 1.5.0

### Next session start
- Task 9: Multi-Agent Orchestration Dashboard

---

## 2026-04-10 — Session 5

### What was done
- Completed Task 7: Permissions & Toolsets Settings UI

**Research findings:**
- `~/.hermes/config.yaml` has rich permissions/sandbox fields: `approvals`, `security`, `toolsets`, `code_execution`, `agent.reasoning_effort`, `agent.verbose`
- Existing settings page already has Agent Behavior (max_turns, gateway_timeout, tool_use_enforcement) but not these
- Existing `PATCH /api/hermes-config` deep-merges config changes — no new backend needed
- `HermesConfigSection` component already handles multi-view dispatch via `sectionContent` map

**What was implemented:**
- `'permissions'` added to `SettingsSectionId` type union
- `{ id: 'permissions', label: 'Permissions & Toolsets' }` added to `SETTINGS_NAV_ITEMS` (appears after "Agent Behavior")
- `HermesConfigSection activeView="permissions"` wired into content area
- `renderPermissions()` function with 4 sub-sections:
  - **Approvals**: mode (manual/auto/off) + timeout slider
  - **Toolsets**: list of active toolsets as removable tags + add-custom input
  - **Security**: redact_secrets, tirith_enabled, website_blocklist toggles
  - **Code Execution**: timeout + max_tool_calls number inputs
  - **Agent Reasoning**: reasoning_effort (low/medium/high) + verbose toggle
- State for `newToolset` input hoisted to `HermesConfigSection` component level (hooks rule compliance)
- `LockIcon` imported from `@hugeicons/core-free-icons`

**Tests passed:**
- TypeScript: zero errors ✅
- Build: clean (3.76s) ✅

### Repo state
- Branch: `dev`
- Version: 1.4.0

### Next session start
- Task 8: Session Persistence via Redis
  - Research what session state is currently stored and where
  - Design Redis adapter for session/history persistence
  - Implement Redis connection + session store

---

## 2026-04-10 — Session 4

### What was done
- Completed Task 6: Cron Job Manager UI (confirmed already shipped in codebase)
- Updated README.md: all "Hermes Workspace" → "Hermes Studio", clone URLs, Docker commands, roadmap, features section, star history chart, version badge 1.0.0 → 1.3.0
- Bumped package.json version: 1.0.0 → 1.3.0
- Updated CHANGELOG.md with v1.3.0 entry (Task 6)
- Committed and pushed to GitHub

**Task 6 research findings:**
- Jobs UI was already fully implemented in hermes-workspace and carried over cleanly
- `GET/POST /api/hermes-jobs` and `GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE /api/hermes-jobs/$jobId` proxy routes complete
- `jobs-api.ts` covers: fetchJobs, createJob, updateJob, deleteJob, pauseJob, resumeJob, triggerJob, fetchJobOutput
- `JobsScreen` wired into workspace-shell.tsx nav and mobile-tab-bar.tsx
- Feature gate: shows BackendUnavailableState if gateway lacks `/api/jobs`
- Auto-refresh every 30s via React Query; run history expandable per card

### Repo state
- Branch: `dev`
- Version: 1.3.0

### Next session start
- Task 7: Permissions & Sandbox Config UI ✅ (see Session 5)

---

## 2026-04-09 — Session 3

### What was done
- Completed Task 5: Skill Installation from web UI

**Research findings:**
- `POST /api/skills/install` and `POST /api/skills/uninstall` already existed and worked
- `POST /api/skills` (toggle) was a 501 Not Implemented stub
- `clawhub` CLI is NOT installed on this machine
- `GET /api/skills` correctly returns skill lists from gateway
- Full install/uninstall/toggle UI was already in `skills-screen.tsx` — wired to the endpoints

**What was implemented:**
- `POST /api/skills` toggle action: reads/writes `~/.hermes/skills/.studio-prefs.json` to track disabled skill IDs; does not require gateway
- `GET /api/skills` merges local prefs to report accurate `enabled` state
- `POST /api/skills/install`: now tries Hermes gateway native endpoint first, then clawhub CLI, then returns `installClawhub: 'pip install skillhub'` if clawhub is missing
- `POST /api/skills/uninstall`: added path traversal security guard

## 2026-04-09 — Session 2

### What was done
- Completed Task 4: Execution Approvals UI (full end-to-end implementation)
- Deep-dived hermes gateway approval mechanism: agent blocks via threading.Event in tools/approval.py; resolved via `/approve` or `/deny` chat commands; gateway has no native HTTP approval endpoints (sessions capability is false)
- Rewrote `src/lib/approvals-store.ts` from no-op stub to real in-memory Map with sessionStorage persistence
- Updated `src/routes/api/send-stream.ts` to translate `approval.required` / `tool.approval` / `exec.approval` gateway SSE events → client `approval` event
- Created `src/routes/api/approvals.$approvalId.approve.ts` — dual strategy: native gateway endpoint first, then chat command `/approve [scope]` fallback
- Created `src/routes/api/approvals.$approvalId.deny.ts` — same pattern, sends `/deny`
- Updated `src/screens/chat/hooks/use-streaming-message.ts` — added `onApprovalRequest` option and `case 'approval'` SSE handler
- Updated `src/screens/chat/chat-screen.tsx` — extracted `handleApprovalRequest` shared callback, wired into both `useRealtimeChatHistory` and `useStreamingMessage`, added "Always Allow" button to approval banner UI, updated `resolvePendingApproval` to pass `scope` body param
- Updated `src/routeTree.gen.ts` — manually registered both new approval routes (TanStack Router codegen not running)
- TypeScript: zero errors (`npx tsc --noEmit` clean)
- Build: clean (`pnpm build` ✓ in 3.51s)

### Repo state
- Branch: `dev`
