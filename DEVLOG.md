## 2026-04-10 — Session 6

### What was done
- Completed Task 8: Session Persistence via Redis

**Research findings:**
- `local-session-store.ts` already existed with correct logic but was dead code — never imported by any API route
- All session/history routes returned empty data in portable mode (gateway unavailable)
- `send-stream.ts` streamed messages but never saved them anywhere in portable mode
- `ioredis` not previously installed; file-based `.runtime/local-sessions.json` approach was designed but inactive

**What was implemented:**
- `local-session-store.ts` extended with optional Redis backend:
  - `tryInitRedis()` — non-blocking async init; pings Redis and merges Redis data into in-memory store
  - `loadFromRedis()` / `saveSessionToRedis()` / `appendMessageToRedis()` / `deleteSessionFromRedis()` helpers
  - Redis key schema: `hermes:studio:sessions` (hash), `hermes:studio:messages:{id}` (list), 30-day TTL
  - Graceful fallback: if `REDIS_URL` unset or Redis unreachable, file store used transparently
- `/api/sessions` — all 4 verbs wired to local store when gateway unavailable:
  - GET: returns `listLocalSessions()` with session metadata
  - POST: calls `ensureLocalSession(friendlyId, model)` — persisted immediately
  - PATCH: calls `updateLocalSessionTitle(sessionKey, label)` — persistent rename
  - DELETE: calls `deleteLocalSession(sessionKey)` — removes from file + Redis
- `/api/history` — when gateway unavailable: resolves session key (explicit → latest → 'new'), returns `getLocalMessages().map(toLocalChatMessage)`
- `send-stream.ts` — portable mode now saves messages:
  - Before stream: `ensureLocalSession(key)` + `appendLocalMessage({ role: 'user', ... })`
  - After stream: `appendLocalMessage({ role: 'assistant', content: accumulated })`
- `ioredis` added as runtime dependency via `pnpm add ioredis`
- `.env.example` updated with `REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379` comment block

**Tests passed (standalone Node.js test script):**
- Session create + file written ✅
- Reload from disk after memory clear (server restart simulation) ✅
- Messages preserved across reload ✅
- Delete session ✅
- 500-message cap enforcement ✅
- TypeScript: zero errors ✅
- Build: clean ✅

### Repo state
- Branch: `dev` → merged to `main`
- Version: 1.5.0

### Next session start
- Task 9: Multi-Agent Orchestration Dashboard

## 2026-04-10 — Session 5

### What was done
- Completed Task 7: Permissions & Toolsets Settings UI

**Research findings:**
- `~/.hermes/config.yaml` has rich permissions/sandbox fields: `approvals`, `security`, `toolsets`, `code_execution`, `agent.reasoning_effort`, `agent.verbose`
- Existing settings page already has Agent Behavior (max_turns, gateway_timeout, tool_use_enforcement) but not these
- Existing `PATCH /api/hermes-config` deep-merges config changes — no new backend needed
- `HermesConfigSection` component already handles multi-view dispatch via `sectionContent` map

**What was implemented:**
- `'permissions'` added to `SettingsSectionId` type union
- `{ id: 'permissions', label: 'Permissions & Toolsets' }` added to `SETTINGS_NAV_ITEMS` (appears after "Agent Behavior")
- `HermesConfigSection activeView="permissions"` wired into content area
- `renderPermissions()` function with 4 sub-sections:
  - **Approvals**: mode (manual/auto/off) + timeout slider
  - **Toolsets**: list of active toolsets as removable tags + add-custom input
  - **Security**: redact_secrets, tirith_enabled, website_blocklist toggles
  - **Code Execution**: timeout + max_tool_calls number inputs
  - **Agent Reasoning**: reasoning_effort (low/medium/high) + verbose toggle
- State for `newToolset` input hoisted to `HermesConfigSection` component level (hooks rule compliance)
- `LockIcon` imported from `@hugeicons/core-free-icons`

**Tests passed:**
- TypeScript: zero errors ✅
- Build: clean (3.76s) ✅

### Repo state
- Branch: `dev`
- Version: 1.4.0

### Next session start
- Task 8: Session Persistence via Redis
  - Research what session state is currently stored and where
  - Design Redis adapter for session/history persistence
  - Implement Redis connection + session store

---

## 2026-04-10 — Session 4

### What was done
- Completed Task 6: Cron Job Manager UI (confirmed already shipped in codebase)
- Updated README.md: all "Hermes Workspace" → "Hermes Studio", clone URLs, Docker commands, roadmap, features section, star history chart, version badge 1.0.0 → 1.3.0
- Bumped package.json version: 1.0.0 → 1.3.0
- Updated CHANGELOG.md with v1.3.0 entry (Task 6)
- Committed and pushed to GitHub

**Task 6 research findings:**
- Jobs UI was already fully implemented in hermes-workspace and carried over cleanly
- `GET/POST /api/hermes-jobs` and `GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE /api/hermes-jobs/$jobId` proxy routes complete
- `jobs-api.ts` covers: fetchJobs, createJob, updateJob, deleteJob, pauseJob, resumeJob, triggerJob, fetchJobOutput
- `JobsScreen` wired into workspace-shell.tsx nav and mobile-tab-bar.tsx
- Feature gate: shows BackendUnavailableState if gateway lacks `/api/jobs`
- Auto-refresh every 30s via React Query; run history expandable per card

### Repo state
- Branch: `dev`
- Version: 1.3.0

### Next session start
- Task 7: Permissions & Sandbox Config UI ✅ (see Session 5)

## 2026-04-09 — Session 3

### What was done
- Completed Task 5: Skill Installation from web UI

**Research findings:**
- `POST /api/skills/install` and `POST /api/skills/uninstall` already existed and worked
- `POST /api/skills` (toggle) was a 501 Not Implemented stub
- `clawhub` CLI is NOT installed on this machine
- `GET /api/skills` correctly returns skill lists from gateway
- Full install/uninstall/toggle UI was already in `skills-screen.tsx` — wired to the endpoints

**What was implemented:**
- `POST /api/skills` toggle action: reads/writes `~/.hermes/skills/.studio-prefs.json` to track disabled skill IDs; does not require gateway
- `GET /api/skills` merges local prefs to report accurate `enabled` state
- `POST /api/skills/install`: now tries Hermes gateway native endpoint first, then clawhub CLI, then returns `installClawhub: 'pip install skillhub'` if clawhub is missing
- `POST /api/skills/uninstall`: added path traversal security guard
- UI: loading spinners (⏳) on action buttons while in progress
- UI: "Installing... may take up to 2 minutes" progress hint
- UI: clawhub-missing inline banner with `pip install skillhub` instructions + dismiss
- UI: success toasts on install/uninstall completion
- Branding: "Hermes Workspace" → "Hermes Studio" in header and security badge

**Tests passed:**
- Toggle disable/enable prefs file round-trip: ✅
- Install with missing clawhub → returns hint: ✅
- Uninstall path traversal attack blocked: ✅
- TypeScript: zero errors ✅
- Build: clean ✅
- Live API tests via pnpm dev: all 5 scenarios ✅

### Repo state
- Branch: `dev`
- Version: 1.2.0

### Next session start
- Task 6: Cron Job Manager UI ✅ (confirmed already shipped — see Session 4)
- Task 7: Permissions & Sandbox Config UI

## 2026-04-09 — Session 2

### What was done
- Completed Task 4: Execution Approvals UI (full end-to-end implementation)
- Deep-dived hermes gateway approval mechanism: agent blocks via threading.Event in tools/approval.py; resolved via `/approve` or `/deny` chat commands; gateway has no native HTTP approval endpoints (sessions capability is false)
- Rewrote `src/lib/approvals-store.ts` from no-op stub to real in-memory Map with sessionStorage persistence
- Updated `src/routes/api/send-stream.ts` to translate `approval.required` / `tool.approval` / `exec.approval` gateway SSE events → client `approval` event
- Created `src/routes/api/approvals.$approvalId.approve.ts` — dual strategy: native gateway endpoint first, then chat command `/approve [scope]` fallback
- Created `src/routes/api/approvals.$approvalId.deny.ts` — same pattern, sends `/deny`
- Updated `src/screens/chat/hooks/use-streaming-message.ts` — added `onApprovalRequest` option and `case 'approval'` SSE handler
- Updated `src/screens/chat/chat-screen.tsx` — extracted `handleApprovalRequest` shared callback, wired into both `useRealtimeChatHistory` and `useStreamingMessage`, added "Always Allow" button to approval banner UI, updated `resolvePendingApproval` to pass `scope` body param
- Updated `src/routeTree.gen.ts` — manually registered both new approval routes (TanStack Router codegen not running)
- TypeScript: zero errors (`npx tsc --noEmit` clean)
- Build: clean (`pnpm build` ✓ in 3.51s)

### Repo state
- Branch: `dev`
- Version: 1.1.0
- Package manager: pnpm

### Next session start
- Task 5: Skill installation from web UI
  - Add "Install" button to skills explorer that calls POST /api/skills/install
  - Show installation state (pending / installed / error) per skill
  - Possibly browse and install from hermes hub registry
